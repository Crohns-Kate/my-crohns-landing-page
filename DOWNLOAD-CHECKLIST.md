# Step 1: Download Project from Replit

## What You Need to Do Right Now:

1. **In your Replit project** (this window):
   - Look at the left sidebar file explorer
   - Click the **three dots menu (⋯)** at the top of the file list
   - Select **"Download as zip"**
   - Save the zip file to your computer (Desktop or Downloads folder)

2. **Extract the files:**
   - Find the downloaded zip file on your computer
   - Right-click → "Extract All" (Windows) or double-click (Mac)
   - Choose a location like Desktop/crohns-landing-page

3. **IMPORTANT - Rename one file:**
   - Open the extracted folder
   - Find `package-production.json`
   - Rename it to `package.json` (remove "production-")
   - This is crucial for deployment to work

## Files You Should See After Extraction:
✅ index.html (main landing page)  
✅ styles.css (all styling)  
✅ server/ folder (backend code)  
✅ privacy-policy.html  
✅ terms-conditions.html  
✅ All image files (.jpg, .png, .svg)  
✅ vercel.json (deployment config)  
✅ package.json (renamed from package-production.json)  
✅ DEPLOYMENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md (your next steps)  

## What NOT to Upload to GitHub:
❌ .replit file  
❌ replit.nix file  
❌ Any .env files with real passwords  

## Ready for Step 2?
Once you have the extracted folder with renamed package.json, you're ready to create your GitHub repository!
