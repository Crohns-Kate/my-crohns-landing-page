# Mobile GitHub Upload Guide

## Step 2: Upload Files to GitHub (On Your Phone)

Since you've created your GitHub repository, now we need to upload all your project files:

### Method: Upload Files One by One

1. **In your GitHub repository page:**
   - Look for "uploading an existing file" link
   - OR click "Add file" â†’ "Upload files"

2. **Upload these files in this order:**

   **FIRST - Main files:**
   - index.html
   - styles.css
   - package-production.json (we'll rename this later)

   **SECOND - Legal pages:**
   - privacy-policy.html
   - terms-conditions.html

   **THIRD - Configuration files:**
   - vercel.json
   - .gitignore
   - .env.example
   - README.md
   - DEPLOYMENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md

   **FOURTH - Images (all of them):**
   - crohns-logo.jpg
   - kate-photo.jpg
   - All other .jpg, .png, .svg files

   **FIFTH - Server folder:**
   - Create folder called "server"
   - Upload all files from server folder

3. **After uploading package-production.json:**
   - Click on the file name
   - Click the pencil icon (edit)
   - Change filename from "package-production.json" to "package.json"
   - Commit the change

4. **Commit message:** "Initial commit - Landing page ready for deployment"

### Alternative: Use GitHub Mobile App
1. Download "GitHub" app from Play Store
2. Sign in with your account
3. Find your repository
4. Use the app to upload files

**Let me know when you've uploaded the main files (index.html, styles.css, package.json) and I'll guide you through the database setup step.**
